Get your favourite news and blogs on your ebook.

We achieve this by parsing news websites and blogs to make them readable by any ebook, be it a Kindle or another device.

We made the app modular so that anybody can contribute creating their own parsers. 
This means that everyone else will be able to read from this new sources.

## Project structure

The project is structured as a monorepo, but frontend (web) and backend (api) are hosted in different services.

Both are node.js projects.

## Installation

Clone the project, open app and api README files and follow the instalation instructions for each of them.

## Contributing

You can contribute in both app and api, but we really encourage people to try creating new parsers. 
This will allow the community to grow healthy and everyone is going to benefit from having more sources to choose from.
